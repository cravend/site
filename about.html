        Hi! My name is Dalton Craven. I'm an 11<sup>th</sup> grader at Mason High School. I've been interested in computers my whole life, and taking programming my freshman year helped me decide that was what I wanted to do. Right now, I'm the Finance Director and Webmaster for Mason Hack Club, as well as the Webmaster for Mason ACM.</p>

      <p class="lead">I'm also learning basic server management & web design through the Integrated Media Internship program. I've interned with the City of Mason's IT team & Various Views Research to get hands-on experience in real-life workplaces. Outside of school, I like working on my 1963 Mercury Comet, reading, and working at Kings Island. Check out my full résumé <a href="/assets/files/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
