      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Dalton Craven. I’m in 12th grade at Mason High School. Freshman year, I decided to take a programming class. That decision helped cement my love for computers and technology, impacting how I spend the majority of my time.

      Currently, I’m the Webmaster and Finance Director for Mason Hack Club. As part of Hack Club, I’ve run numerous computer programming events. The biggest event I ran was CincyHacks, Cincinnati’s first high school hackathon. With over 60 participants, the event was a roaring success. Additionally, I helped run Mason Hack Camp, a programming workshop for 5th to 8th graders. I also help manage the day-to-day aspects of the club, helping students work on various projects collaboratively.

      I’m also the webmaster and Server Admin for Mason High School’s sites. Including masoncomets.org, gomasoncomets.com, masondrama.com, and various other sites, we have an estimated reach of 1,000,000 views per year. I recently transferred all web data over to a completely new server, with no downtime. I’m additionally leading a team that creates various graphics for a site. Finally, I’m creating a brand-new, modern website that will be the face of Mason High School for years to come.
