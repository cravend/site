      Hi! My name is Dalton Craven &amp; I’m in 12th grade at Mason High School.

    <p>
      Freshman year, I decided to take an introduction to programming class. The
      class sparked my passion — I immediately got involved in coding. I joined{' '}

      (not knowing much about website development), then became the{' '}
      <Highlight>webmaster and finance director</Highlight>. I've been able to
      run a lot of events through the club -- a full list of events is detailed
      here.

    <p>
      Along with that, I have become increasingly involved with the Integrated
      Media/Advanced Production Lab at my school, which centers around a
      freeform media production “agency.” Freshman year, I took on the role of{' '}
      <Highlight>managing the school website’s content.</Highlight> I then began
      to do more maintenance, until I eventually ended up managing all aspects
      of the high school websites, including{' '}

      per year.{' '}

        I recently transferred all of our website data over to a completely new

      I’ve also tried to get some real-world experience. This past summer, I

      Abre is an online educational platform: it provides a way for schools to
      manage classes, grades, and more, all in one dashboard. As an intern,{' '}
      <Highlight>I developed an Abre app</Highlight> that would let students and
      advisors manage clubs through Abre. The summer before, I interned with{' '}

      Additionally, I love to read. I volunteer at the Public Library of
