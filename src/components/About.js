      Hi! My name is Dalton Craven &amp; I’m a student at the University of
      South Carolina.

    <p>
      I’ve been working with computer science for my entire high school career,
      and I am excited to continue to pursue it at the University of South
      Carolina. My passion for computer science was sparked by Mason Hack Club,
      a programming club dedicated to teaching students how to code. I've also
      been able to run a wide variety of projects!
