I was first introduced to the world of computer science in high school through <a href='https://hackclub.com'>Hack Club</a>, a network of student-run programming organizations. I then went on to study both theoretical and applied computer science at the University of South Carolina, where I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S.C.S. in Computer Science.",

These experiences were invaluable in shaping my worldview and broadening my horizons. I was able to experience a new culture, learn a new language, and make lifelong friends. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of localization and accessibility in software development.",

Wordification is currently in the proof-of-concept stage, but our team is eagerly looking forward to conducting real-world, peer-reviewed trials with students soon. We recently submitted a research paper to a paper about Wordification to the <a href='https://www.american-cse.org/csce2023/conferences-FECS'>19<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science & Computer Engineering</a>, which was accepted for publication — we're excited about presenting our work this July. Wordification is built with Redwood and Typescript, and is <a href='https://github.com/wordification/app'>visible on GitHub</a>."

Given the significant workload, I assumed multiple roles — developer, devops manager, and scrum master. The final product was a full-stack web application built with Next.js, Typescript, Firestore, and the Spotify Web SDK. Some key features included the ability to dynamically load content, tailored recommendations based on a user's listening activity, and audio analysis of songs, albums, artists, and playlists. The project is <a href='https://dkms.vercel.app'>deployed on Vercel</a>, and the code is <a href='https://github.com/sccapstone/dkms'>visible on GitHub</a>."
