          <p>Hi! My name is Dalton Craven. I’m in 11<sup>th</sup> grade at Mason High School. Freshman year, I decided to take a programming class. That decision helped cement my love for computers and technology, impacting how I spend the majority of my time.</p>
          <p>Currently, I’m the Webmaster and Finance Director for <a href="https://masonhackclub.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mason Hack Club</a>. As part of Hack Club, I’ve run numerous computer programming events. The biggest event I ran was <a href="https://cincyhacks.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CincyHacks</a>, Cincinnati’s first high school hackathon. With over 60 participants, the event was a roaring success. Additionally, I helped run <a href="https://camp.masonhackclub.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mason Hack Camp</a>, a programming workshop for 5th to 8th graders. I also help manage the day-to-day aspects of the club, helping students work on various projects collaboratively.</p>
          <p>I’m also the webmaster and Server Admin for Mason High School’s sites. Including <a href="http://masoncomets.org" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">masoncomets.org</a>, <a href="http://gomasoncomets.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gomasoncomets.com</a>, <a href="https://masondrama.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">masondrama.com</a>, and various other sites, we have an estimated reach of 1,000,000 views per year. I recently transferred all web data over to a completely new server, with no downtime. I’m additionally leading a team that creates various graphics for a site. Finally, I’m creating a brand-new, modern website that will be the face of Mason High School for years to come.</p>

      <p>Outside of school, I’ve had various internships. These have given me real-life workplace experience. I was an IT intern for the <a href="https://www.imaginemason.org" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">City of Mason</a>. There, I helped run and update the governmental intranet. Additionally, I interned with <a href="http://variousviews.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Various Views Research</a>, creating the framework for a new, flexible website that they are planning on customizing further before releasing.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I love to read. I volunteer at the <a href="http://www.cincinnatilibrary.org" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County</a> weekly (with almost 200 hours logged!), assisting patrons with their various questions about library technology, finding books, or just general knowledge. I’ve worked at <a href="https://www.visitkingsisland.com" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kings Island</a> since 2016 as a busser, host, and guest coordinator. Additionally, I love maintaining my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eL3Xi6jXbr40xKJ62" class="hover-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1963 Mercury Comet</a>.</p>
