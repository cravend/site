This is the personal website of Dalton Craven, made using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I prioritize web accessibility and performance. I chose Astro because it allows me to strip out all JS from my site, while still feeling more reactive than pure HTML. I also used Tailwind for styling. This results in a website that looks modern but takes up ~50kb of space and loads functionally instantly.

For those who are curious, this repository contains all previous versions of my personal website. I like to use it as a testing ground to learn about new technologies and practice my skills.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.
